## How did I decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
-> It's simple, I developed a roadmap of the application and then decided to use react.js as the front-end framework beacuse of it's great developer experience and flexibility. Also react has alot of support libraries or npm packages and is compatible with a wide variety of other tech. For styling, I have used bootstrap as it provides a very simple and easy to code css library and classes.

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
-> Of'course yes. The application can be modified into having the history of the requests within the history tab. Also, it would be great to pass files along with requests. The user experience with the editor used can also be improved. 

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would try to make the application a lot more user-friendly w.r.t it's interaction with the user. Also, include the history tab to view previous requests and try to make collections for every group of requests. I would also enable user authentication to load specific past requests made by their account.
The editor would also be made more user-friendly and easy to use w.r.t the user.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
